Source code for using Reduce to construct emergent models of complex dynamical systems.

CentreManifold: obtain a centre manifold of your specified
system of ordinary differential equations
(<small>ODE</small>) or delay differential equations
(<small>DDE</small>), when the <small>ODE/DDE</small> has
fast and centre modes.  This code underlies the web service at
